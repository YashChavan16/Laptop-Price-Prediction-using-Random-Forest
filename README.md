# Laptop Price Prediction using Random Forest Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for predicting laptop prices using the Random Forest algorithm. The project aims to provide a reliable and accurate model for estimating the price of laptops based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes a comprehensive set of laptop specifications and corresponding prices. It is sourced from [insert dataset source]. The data is preprocessed and cleaned to ensure optimal performance of the Random Forest algorithm.

## Methodology

The Random Forest algorithm is employed for its ability to handle complex datasets and deliver robust predictions. The model is trained on a subset of the dataset and validated to ensure its effectiveness. Hyperparameter tuning is also performed to optimize the model's performance.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/laptop-price-prediction.git
   cd laptop-price-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook laptop_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   python laptop_price_prediction.py
   ```

4. Input the relevant laptop specifications and obtain the predicted price.

## Results

The model's performance metrics, such as accuracy and mean absolute error, are documented in the notebook. Visualizations and insights into the feature importance are also included.
